# Clustering

Comparitive performance study of different clustering algorithms using different pre-processing techniques with different numbers of clusters on different evaluation parameters.

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into several groups such that data points in the same groups are similar to other data points in that group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically an assembly of objects based on similarity and dissimilarity between them.

CLustering algorithms used:  K-mean, Hierarchial, K-mean shift
Evaluation Parameters: Silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz Index,  Davies-Bouldin Index
Pre processing Techniques: No preprocessing, Normalization, Principle Component Analysis, Transformation, Transformation+Normalization,  Transformation+Normalization+Principle Component Analysis
Number of clusters: 3,4,5
